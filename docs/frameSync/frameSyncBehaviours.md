# **FrameSyncBehaviours**

The `FrameSyncBehaviour` class derives from `MonoBehaviour`. It acts as the unique identifier of a GameObject. All of the networked GameObjects should have a `FrameSyncBehaviour` component. 

!!! info

    To implement game logic and to store game states, implement [IFrameSyncStart][1], [IFrameSyncPlayerUpdate][2], [IFrameSyncComputerUpdate][3], and [IFrameSyncDataContainer][3] interfaces in your `MonoBehaviour` component scripts and attach them to your networked GameObjects.

## **StaticFrameSyncBehaviours**
Designed for GameObjects that are **not** dynamically instantiated or destroyed. If a GameObject is instantiated or destroyed at runtime, `DynamicFrameSyncBehaviour` should be used.

## **DynamicFrameSyncBehaviours**
Designed for GameObjects that are dynamically instantiated or destroyed.

???+ info

    `DynamicFrameSyncBehaviour` components will be automatically added to the GameObjects created at runtime.
    
    You don't need to add it to your prefabs.


## **Properties**

| **Name**       | **Function**                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Frame Sync Owner     |  The owner of the `FrameSyncBehaviour`. For `StaticFrameSyncBehaviour`, its owner should be set in the editor. For `DynamicFrameSyncBehaviour`, it's owner is set on creation.  |
| Large Data Container       |  By default, a `FrameSyncBehaviour` can contain up to 256 bytes of data. If `Large Data Container` is enabled, the limit is increased to 4096 bytes.  |
| id      |  The UInt32 unique identifier of the GameObject. The property is for debug purpose and is readonly.  |

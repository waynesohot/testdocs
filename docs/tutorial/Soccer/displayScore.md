# **Display The Scores**

In this section, you will update the HUD to display the scores.

- Add a `StaticFrameSyncBehaviour` to the `GameFlow` GameObject. We want to access the `FrameSyncGame` in the `SoccerGameFlow` script to get the time elapsed since the game started.
- Set the `Owner` of the `StaticFrameSyncBehaviour` to computer because the `GameFlow` is not owned by any player.
- Add the highlighted lines to the `SoccerGameFlow` script.
- Drag the `Time`, `Player1`, and `Player2` text to the SoccerGameFlow inspector.

                }
            }
        }
    }

    ```
